‚ö†Ô∏è This is really not clean and tidy, don't do this at home ‚ö†Ô∏è

I just tried to figure out the solutions by typing directly in the DevTools console. I read the input by selecting the `<pre>` tag in the Elements panel, which I then accessed from the console with `$0`.

(not so) Pro-tip üî•: I used `var` instead of `let` or `const` to be able to redeclare the same variable multiple times, otherwise I needed to reload the page each time I messed up (but [Chrome DevTools will soon support that](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/12/devtools#redeclarations)).
